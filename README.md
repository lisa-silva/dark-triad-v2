# Dark Triad Detector Quiz  

A behavioral insights app built with **Streamlit**, designed to explore personality traits through an interactive quiz. This project represents my first end-to-end deployed application and serves as a milestone in my journey as a self-taught developer.  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  
The **Dark Triad Detector Quiz** is more than just a quiz—it’s a demonstration of my ability to:  
- **Conceptualize** an idea from scratch  
- **Build** a functional digital product with Python and Streamlit  
- **Deploy** it publicly on Streamlit and GitHub for others to use  

This project reflects my early exploration into **data handling**, **UI/UX design**, and **user engagement funnels**, while also proving my willingness to launch real, usable products.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **Streamlit** – Interactive web app framework  
- **Pandas** – Data handling and analysis  
- **GitHub** – Version control and project hosting  
- **Streamlit Cloud** – Deployment platform  

---

## 📚 Lessons Learned  
Building this project taught me valuable lessons that shaped how I approach future apps:  
- Managing **user state** in Streamlit  
- Designing for **responsiveness** and smooth user experience  
- Writing clear **documentation** for both technical and non-technical audiences  
- Deploying and maintaining a live app  

---

## 🔑 Key Features  
- Interactive quiz with real-time results  
- Clean, minimal UI for accessibility  
- Deployed and accessible via Streamlit Cloud  
- Open-source codebase for transparency and iteration  

---

## 🌱 Growth Path  
This project laid the foundation for my later work. For example:  
- After building this quiz, I applied my knowledge of **data handling** and **UI design** to create more robust apps, such as a **personal finance tracker** and a **political fact-checking tool**.  
- It remains a **badge of honor** in my portfolio, showing where I started and how far I’ve come.

## 💻 How to Run Locally  

Follow these steps to run the app on your machine:  

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dark-triad-detector.git
   cd dark-triad-detector
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit app**  
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Open in your browser**  
   Streamlit will provide a local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`) where you can interact with the app.
