    "Cash Drop Taunt: Does he throw cash at you like it's a peace offering-like leaving crumpled bills for your dog to chew, acting like sixteen bucks from his $500-a-day haul is some grand gesture, then act pissed when you don't kiss his ass for it?",
    "Blame Shift Denial: When you try to talk about his bullshit-like his random jabs where he calls you a 'bitch looking for other dudes'-does he dodge, twist it into 'you're resentful,' and blame your journaling like you're the problem, never once saying sorry?",
